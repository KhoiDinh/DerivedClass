# DerivedClass
Using the Derived-Class.cpp file, create an additional derived class (sub class) of type Employee. The Employee class must be derived from the Person class and include the following data items:     int  EmpNo;    // Employee number     double Hours;     double PayRate; The print method for Employee needs to compute the pay based on Hours and PayRate and then display the Name, and Pay. Update the main program to include at least two employees.
